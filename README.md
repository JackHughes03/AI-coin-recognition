# Coin Image Classification

An AI model that classifies different types of coins.

## Description

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of various coins. The model is trained on a dataset from Kaggle containing images of different coins from around the world.

The current model was trained on a dataset consisting of a mixture of:
- Modern day coins
- Roman Republican coins

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Conda (recommended for TensorFlow installation)
- Required packages:
  - TensorFlow
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - Pysimplegui

## How to Run

1. Install the requirements.txt

2. Create the dataset by running install.sh. It will do everything for you.

5. Running the model:
   - Execute `main.py`
   - Choose train and wait till the process is finished
